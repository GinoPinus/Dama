This project, developed by Simone La Salvia and Melek Chteoui, consists of creating a digital version of Italian checkers with an intuitive graphical interface. The program is presented through a main window that displays the checkerboard on the left side, where the game takes place, along with a visual indicator of the active player's turn, while the right side shows the updated count of the pieces remaining for each player.

The game follows the traditional rules of Italian checkers. The board consists of 64 squares, 32 white and 32 dark, and the pieces are initially placed on the dark squares. Each player starts with 12 pieces, white for one player and black for the other. The board must be positioned so that each player has a dark square on their right. The objective of the game is to capture all the opponent's pieces to achieve victory.
